In each of the scenarios, find possible shortcomings of the theoretical or actual data sources to answer the given question. What could be done to either adjust the analysis or reframe the question so that you can answer it accurately?

    Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?
    
There are several likely issues here. The proximity to Christmas might mean that this is not typical of the rest of the year. Also, popular neighborhoods may have little housing, or may have restrictions on AirBnB from renting properties there. 

Ways to adjust the analysis would be to include multiple dates or determine if all areas have AirBnB coverage. Reframing the question would probably be done by making it more specific: "Which AirBnB-supported Amsterdam neighborhoods are most poplular at Christmas?

    Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

The big issue here is the date. September 12, 2001 was a very non-typical date in NYC.  Also, the word "paterns" in the question indicated that one day's data, even a typical day, won't be enough. Also, I'd be interested in how the systems compare before making any judgements on their use. In a simplistic example, if NY had 1 mental health clinic, and SF had 50, that will effect their use patterns.

As far as adjusting the analysis, get more days, and get away from 9/11 unless that is specifically what you are studying. The question might be change to reflect the data: "How did mental health service patterns vary between two cities after the 9/11 attacks."

    Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?

The honesty of the responses, and the makeup of the respondees is in question. Guys who drink every day because they are alcoholics who are trying to ease the pain of their everyday life don't tend to sit around doing online surveys, so those reasons might be a little underrepresented. It has all the risks of an online survey, like self selection, unverifiable answers. Also, I'd be interested to know how they get the responses. Are the categories broad/narrow enough to give us a good view of things? Did a translator have to guess? 

It seems that it is 79% "Hang outs with friends" and 70% students.  Perhaps the quesion could be more focused to indicate the makeup of the majority of the surveyed group rather than talking about Armenians in gerneral.
